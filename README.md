# BetterShufleButton
A shuffle button that queues songs that relate to the song that came before it using Anaconda, Juypter, multiple Python libraries and machine learning.
This project was made as a capstone project done at Neumont College of Computer Science.
I worked on this project from January 6, 2020 to March 12, 2020.
