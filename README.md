# BetterShufleButton
A shuffle button that queues songs that relate to the song that came before it using Anaconda, Juypter, multiple Python libraries and machine learning.
This project was made as a capstone project done at Neumont College of Computer Science.
I worked on this project from January 6, 2020 to March 12, 2020.
The data I used was from 'Spotify Dataset 1921-2020, 160k+ Tracks' by Yama√ß Eren Ay on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks
