# BetterShufleButton
This is a shuffle button that "analyizes" your mood. 
Currently, Spotify's shuffle button only shuffles top played tracks you have listened to with a dash of truly random songs.
This shuffle button analyizes a selected song and queue's other songs that fit the mood/vibe.
This was created as a capstone at Neumont College Of Computer Science - Jan 5, 2021 to Mar 12, 2021
